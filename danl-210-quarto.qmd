# Python Basics

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This is a simple Python code:

```{python}
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables can store data of different types without explicitly declaring the type.

For example:

```{python}
integer_variable = 10
string_variable = 'Hello'
float_variable = 10.5

float_variable
```

## Control Structures

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

```{python}
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
```

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in 'if statements' and loops.

```{python}
# if statement:
if 5 > 2:
    print('Five is greater than two!')
```

## Functions

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.


```{python}
# Defining a function:
def my_function():
    print('Hello from a function')

# Calling a function:
my_function()
```

## Lists and Dictionaries

A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.

```{python}
# List example:
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Dictionary example:
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 36}
```



# Pandas Basics - Orange Juice Sales

## Import Python libraries

`!pip install dtale` to install `dtale` library
```{python}
!pip install dtale
import pandas as pd
import dtale
```



```{python}
oj = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/dominick_oj.csv')
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Code!"
oj
```


```{python}
dtale.show(oj) 
```
